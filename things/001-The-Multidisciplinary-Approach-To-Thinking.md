# [The Multidisciplinary Approach to Thinking](http://latticeworkinvesting.com/2018/04/06/peter-kaufman-on-the-multidisciplinary-approach-to-thinking/)

~ **Peter Kaufman**

### Why Multidisciplinary Thinking?

‘To understand is to know what to do.’ (Ludwig Wittgenstein).
To know what to do in the complex, dynamic systems of life, we need to be a multidisciplinary thinker. Because then we'd know the ocean instead of being holed up
in one well.

So "the key is to know the big ideas from all the different disciplines".

### Peter's approach

How did he do it?

He read 144 interviews in the Discover Magazine (over a period of six months) 
to get in his head "every single big idea from every single domain of science and biology".

### The Three Buckets

Now, to make sure the ideas we pull are valid, we need to ensure they have large sample sizes. As such, here are 
three buckets with large sample sizes, we can pull from:

- Bucket 1: 13.7 billion years which is the inorganic universe. So: Physics, Geology. This is where we live.
- Bucket 2: 3.5 billion years which is biology on planet Earth. This is what we're part of.
- Bucket 3: 20,000 years of recorded human history. This is who we are.

Next we derive **simple** principles from these buckets. Why simple? Because (the good kind of) simple is above genius in that it's understandable.


### How everything works

First, we derive a "two word description that accurately describes how everything in the world works": **mirrored reciprocation**.
Examples: Newton's third law of motion (Physics), how a cat reacts when you pull it by its tail vs when you gently stroke its tummy (Biology).

So what you put in is what you get. 

> Every interaction you have with another human being is merely mirrored reciprocation.

### The most powerful force we can harness

Next, what’s the most powerful force that we as human beings, both as individuals and groups, can potentially harness towards achieving our ends in life?
> Ans: dogged incremental constant progress over a very long time frame

Examples: Evolution (biology), Compound interest (Mathematics, economics)

Also, it's important to be constant and not intermittent.

### What everybody in the world is looking for; how humans are alike

What everybody is looking for:

> An individual that you can 100 percent absolutely and completely trust. But who’s not just trustworthy, but principled, and courageous, and competent, and kind, and loyal, and understanding, and forgiving, and unselfish.

Which brings us to this guiding principle for leadership: "in every single one of your interactions with others, be the list!"

All human beings are alike. We have the same needs. Among them: being paid attention to, listened to, and respected. As such:

> All you have to do, if you want everything in life from everybody else, is first pay attention, listen to them, show them respect, give them meaning, satisfaction, and fulfillment. Convey to them that they matter to you. And show you love them. But you have to go first. And what are you going to get back? Mirrored reciprocation.

In essence, be like a dog: Go all in with unconditional love. 

**Go positive, go first**. 98% of the time, you'll get back something positive. 

All this is simple but why don't we do this more often? Because of loss aversion. Because of the 2% chance we'll get screwed.

The key is to risk the 2%.

### Investments and leadership

"The three hallmarks of a great investment are superior returns, low risk, and long duration". 

Most focus on the first. For the latter two, we need to think win-win.

> "The basic axiom of clinical psychology reads, ‘If you could see the world the way I see it, you’d understand why I behave the way I do.’"

> "The secret to leadership is to see through the eyes of all six important counterparty groups and make sure that everything you do is structured in such a way to be win-win with them. So here are the six. Your customers, your suppliers, your employees, your owners, your regulators, and the communities you operate in."

### Going together and what really matters in life

> "If you want to go quickly go alone, if you want to go far, go together."

Failing to do this (by going quickly alone) can cause one to succeed in whatever one is doing but fail in life, to not have what really matters.

> "What really matters is to have people pay attention to you, listen to you, and respect you, show you that you matter, and to love you. And to have it be genuine, not bought".

As such:

> "The essence of life is to surround yourself, as continuously as you can, with good company".

## Closing Notes

To navigate the complexities of life, we need all the help we can get. As such, it is important to pull from as many disciplines as possible insights into 
how to go about living.
